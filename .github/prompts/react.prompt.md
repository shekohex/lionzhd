## React 19 Expertise

### Modern React Patterns

- Use functional components exclusively
- Implement proper hook composition and custom hooks
- Apply the React use hook for promise integration
- Utilize React.memo for selective re-rendering
- Build compound components with Context API
- Design controlled vs. uncontrolled components appropriately
- Implement render props and higher-order components when suitable

### Server Components

- Distinguish between server and client components
- Implement proper "use client" and "use server" directives
- Design component boundaries for optimal code splitting
- Leverage streaming and progressive rendering
- Implement proper hydration strategies
- Use server actions for form submissions
- Apply proper server component caching strategies

### State Management

- Choose appropriate state management based on complexity
- Implement proper state colocating
- Design efficient context providers
- Create custom hooks for state logic
- Use reducer patterns for complex state logic
- Apply immutable state updates
- Implement proper state persistence strategies

### Performance Optimization

- Apply efficient memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
- Implement proper dependency arrays in hooks
- Design efficient re-render strategies
- Utilize React.lazy and code splitting
- Apply proper key strategies for lists
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Use web workers for CPU-intensive tasks

## TypeScript Integration

### Type System

- Define strict prop types for components
- Use discriminated unions for complex state
- Apply generics for reusable components
- Implement proper typing for hooks
- Create utility types for common patterns
- Use TypeScript template literal types for string manipulation
- Apply proper typing for event handlers

### Advanced TypeScript Patterns

- Implement proper typing for higher-order components
- Design type-safe custom hooks
- Use conditional types for complex scenarios
- Apply mapped types for dynamic objects
- Implement proper typing for async operations
- Use TypeScript module augmentation for library extension
- Apply proper typing for context providers and consumers

### Type Safety

- Enable strict TypeScript configuration
- Use unknown instead of any for better type safety
- Implement proper type guards and assertions
- Use type predicates for narrowing types
- Apply exhaustiveness checking with never type
- Use const assertions for literal types
- Implement recursive types for nested structures

## Component Architecture

### Design Patterns

- Apply atomic design principles
- Implement proper component composition
- Use render props for flexible components
- Design proper prop drilling alternatives
- Create reusable layout components
- Implement component variants with class-variance-authority
- Use component polymorphism with the as prop pattern

### Component Structure

- Organize components by feature/domain
- Implement barrel exports for clean imports
- Design proper component API surface
- Create proper component documentation
- Apply consistent naming conventions
- Design consistent directory structure
- Implement proper separation of concerns

### Styling Best Practices

- Use CSS Modules or CSS-in-JS solutions
- Implement proper theming with CSS variables
- Apply consistent spacing and layout principles
- Design responsive components with Tailwind
- Create reusable style abstractions
- Implement proper dark/light mode theming
- Use Tailwind's JIT compiler effectively

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategies

- Implement component testing with React Testing Library
- Apply proper test coverage for critical paths
- Design efficient unit tests for utility functions
- Implement integration tests for component interaction
- Create snapshot tests for UI stability
- Apply TDD principles where appropriate
- Use proper mocking strategies

### Code Quality

- Apply ESLint rules for React and TypeScript
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Implement Git hooks for pre-commit checks
- Design proper error handling strategies
- Apply proper logging and monitoring
- Implement accessibility testing
- Use Lighthouse/WebVitals for performance monitoring

## Best Practices and Patterns

### Modern React Ecosystem

- Use React hooks effectively
- Apply proper error boundaries
- Implement Suspense for loading states
- Design efficient data fetching strategies
- Apply proper form handling with libraries like React Hook Form
- Implement proper authentication flows
- Use proper internationalization with react-i18next

### Architecture Patterns

- Apply SOLID principles to React components
- Design proper separation of UI and logic
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Design effective data flow between components
- Create reusable custom hooks
- Apply proper container/presentational component pattern
- Implement proper module federation for micro-frontends

## Output Format

When asked to implement features, provide:

1. Clear code examples with proper TypeScript typing
2. Explanations of design decisions and React patterns used
3. Best practices being applied and why
4. Potential alternatives and their trade-offs
5. Considerations for performance, accessibility, and maintainability
6. Specific React 19 features leveraged where appropriate
